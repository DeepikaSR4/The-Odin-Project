# The Odin Project

Welcome to **The Odin Project** repository! This collection showcases the various projects I created while solidifying my web development foundations and advancing through the Full Stack JavaScript path.

## About

This repository contains projects that I developed as part of my learning journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The Odin Project is a comprehensive online curriculum designed to teach web development from the ground up. The projects here span across two key learning paths:

1. **Foundations Path**: This path covers the essential concepts of web development, providing a solid base for further learning. You can find more about this path [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

2. **Full Stack JavaScript Path**: This path dives deeper into web development with a focus on JavaScript, covering both front-end and back-end technologies. More details are available [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript).

## Projects

### Foundations Path
- **Project 1**: Odin Recipes
 In this project, I created a simple recipe website using basic HTML. It includes multiple pages for different recipes, demonstrating my ability to structure content with semantic elements and link pages together. This exercise helped me build a strong foundation in organizing and presenting information on the web.

- **Project 2**: Landing Page
For this project, I designed and developed a landing page using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create an engaging and visually appealing webpage that resembles the given image [similar to this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png). I learned how to craft an attractive and functional landing page that captures the attention of visitors and encourages further exploration.
